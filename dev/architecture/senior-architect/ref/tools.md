# Tools Overview

Detailed reference for all three architecture analysis tools.

---

## 1. Architecture Diagram Generator

Generates architecture diagrams from project structure in multiple formats.

**Solves:** "I need to visualize my system architecture for documentation or team discussion"

**Input:** Project directory path
**Output:** Diagram code (Mermaid, PlantUML, or ASCII)

**Supported diagram types:**
- `component` - Shows modules and their relationships
- `layer` - Shows architectural layers (presentation, business, data)
- `deployment` - Shows deployment topology

**Usage:**
```bash
# Mermaid format (default)
python scripts/architecture_diagram_generator.py ./project --format mermaid --type component

# PlantUML format
python scripts/architecture_diagram_generator.py ./project --format plantuml --type layer

# ASCII format (terminal-friendly)
python scripts/architecture_diagram_generator.py ./project --format ascii

# Save to file
python scripts/architecture_diagram_generator.py ./project -o architecture.md
```

**Example output (Mermaid):**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[API Gateway] --> B[Auth Service]
    A --> C[User Service]
    B --> D[(PostgreSQL)]
    C --> D
```

## 2. Dependency Analyzer

Analyzes project dependencies for coupling, circular dependencies, and outdated packages.

**Solves:** "I need to understand my dependency tree and identify potential issues"

**Input:** Project directory path
**Output:** Analysis report (JSON or human-readable)

**Analyzes:**
- Dependency tree (direct and transitive)
- Circular dependencies between modules
- Coupling score (0-100)
- Outdated packages

**Supported package managers:**
- npm/yarn (`package.json`)
- Python (`requirements.txt`, `pyproject.toml`)
- Go (`go.mod`)
- Rust (`Cargo.toml`)

**Usage:**
```bash
# Human-readable report
python scripts/dependency_analyzer.py ./project

# JSON output for CI/CD integration
python scripts/dependency_analyzer.py ./project --output json

# Check only for circular dependencies
python scripts/dependency_analyzer.py ./project --check circular

# Verbose mode with recommendations
python scripts/dependency_analyzer.py ./project --verbose
```

**Example output:**
```
Dependency Analysis Report
==========================
Total dependencies: 47 (32 direct, 15 transitive)
Coupling score: 72/100 (moderate)

Issues found:
- CIRCULAR: auth → user → permissions → auth
- OUTDATED: lodash 4.17.15 → 4.17.21 (security)

Recommendations:
1. Extract shared interface to break circular dependency
2. Update lodash to fix CVE-2020-8203
```

## 3. Project Architect

Analyzes project structure and detects architectural patterns, code smells, and improvement opportunities.

**Solves:** "I want to understand the current architecture and identify areas for improvement"

**Input:** Project directory path
**Output:** Architecture assessment report

**Detects:**
- Architectural patterns (MVC, layered, hexagonal, microservices indicators)
- Code organization issues (god classes, mixed concerns)
- Layer violations
- Missing architectural components

**Usage:**
```bash
# Full assessment
python scripts/project_architect.py ./project

# Verbose with detailed recommendations
python scripts/project_architect.py ./project --verbose

# JSON output
python scripts/project_architect.py ./project --output json

# Check specific aspect
python scripts/project_architect.py ./project --check layers
```

**Example output:**
```
Architecture Assessment
=======================
Detected pattern: Layered Architecture (confidence: 85%)

Structure analysis:
  ✓ controllers/  - Presentation layer detected
  ✓ services/     - Business logic layer detected
  ✓ repositories/ - Data access layer detected
  ⚠ models/       - Mixed domain and DTOs

Issues:
- LARGE FILE: UserService.ts (1,847 lines) - consider splitting
- MIXED CONCERNS: PaymentController contains business logic

Recommendations:
1. Split UserService into focused services
2. Move business logic from controllers to services
3. Separate domain models from DTOs
```
